# Christmas Wishlist WebApp

An academic project for Distributed Systems (CS-GY-9223) at NYU Tandon with Prof Gustavo Sandoval

Objective: To develop a distributed and reliable backend in support of a simple social media application. 

Our application is a wishlist tool where users can login, create posts, follow other users, and view posts of the people they follow. The webserver, written in Go, interacts with the client using gRPCs. [CoreOS](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/tree/main/raft), an open source Raft implementation, is used in the backend to provide consensus for the raft nodes that are spun up locally. 

Please see the [Project Prompt](https://github.com/sidistic/ds_final/blob/main/Project_Prompt.pdf) for more details.
